## Flutter Check-In/Check-Out Application

Description

This Flutter application facilitates appointment-based check-in and check-out functionality using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. Users can perform check-in and check-out actions and the application ensures data persistence even in offline scenarios.

# Features

User-friendly UI for intuitive check-in/check-out experience.
Secure API integration for sending data to the server (using provided example).
Offline data storage using SQLite for local record keeping.
Online/Offline detection for automatic data synchronization.
CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated build and deployment.

# Code Structure (MVVM Architecture)

This application utilizes the MVVM architecture for separation of concerns:

- model: Represents data objects like employee information and check-in/check-out data.
- view: Contains the UI components (widgets) responsible for displaying data and user interaction.
- viewmodel: Acts as a mediator between the view and model, handling business logic, data fetching/storage, and exposing data to the view.
